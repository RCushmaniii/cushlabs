## Session: 2026-05-10

### Accomplished
- PR #92 merged: defaulted site theme to `light` (removed time-of-day logic in `ThemeScript.astro`); fixed 3 reported Tailwind v4 warnings (`bg-gradient-to-b` → `bg-linear-to-b`, `focus:z-[9999]` → `focus:z-9999`, `flex-shrink-0` → `shrink-0`); swept 35 files for the same legacy v3 patterns (17× `flex-shrink-*`, 17× `bg-gradient-*`, 2× arbitrary `-z-[5]`).
- PR #93 merged: Dependabot fix via `package.json` overrides (`fast-xml-parser ≥5.7.0`, `yaml ≥2.8.3`); `npm audit fix` cleared incidental postcss XSS; canonical guardrail added to `BaseLayout.astro` (strips protocol+host before `new URL(p, Astro.site)`, closes recurring failure mode #2 from PR #80).
- SEO: tightened 7 over-length titles/descriptions on `/services/` (EN+ES) and `/voice-agent/` (EN+ES); added `ny-english-messenger-bot` to `metaTitles` overrides on `[slug].astro` (EN+ES). Replaced `&` with comma in services title to avoid `&amp;` (5ch) pushing rendered length past 60.
- Fixed regex bug in `scripts/audit-predeploy.ts`: alternation `["']` was truncating descriptions at apostrophes (e.g. "Driver's License"); switched to backreference `(["'])(.*?)\1`.

### Decisions Made
- Deferred `shadow-sm` → `shadow-xs` migration (83 occurrences, 43 files): semantic shift, every shadow gets one tier larger; needs side-by-side visual review before flipping.
- Deferred `outline-none` migration (18 occurrences, 6 files): in v4 it actually removes outlines (was no-op in v3); accessibility risk for keyboard users, needs per-case decision (`outline-hidden` vs `focus-visible:ring-*`).
- Discarded `projects.generated.json` from both PR commits per CLAUDE.md "stage explicitly" rule — it regenerates on every build with timestamp drift.

### Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] `shadow-sm` → `shadow-xs` migration with side-by-side visual review (83 sites).
- [ ] `outline-none` accessibility audit per-case across 6 files.
- [ ] HowTo schema on `/messenger-assistant/` or `/voice-agent/` ("How to add an AI assistant in 3 steps") — Low-priority tech debt #4.
- [ ] Port GSC/IndexNow scripts to voice.cushlabs.ai repo.

### Technical Debt
- `shadow-sm` semantic drift not yet addressed (deferred from PR #92).
- `outline-none` accessibility risk not yet addressed (deferred from PR #92).
- HowTo schema still missing site-wide.

### Open Questions / Blockers
- None.

## Session: 2026-05-09

### Accomplished
- Diagnosed Ahrefs audit cascade: 4 errors / 11 warnings / 74 notices traced to a single root cause — 4 `noindex` Messenger OAuth callback pages (`/messenger-assistant/{connect,connected}/` EN+ES) leaking into `sitemap-index.xml`.
- Shipped fix on `fix/ahrefs-noindex-sitemap-cascade` (PR #95): sitemap filter excludes the 4 OAuth routes; `robots.txt` adds explicit `Disallow` rules; duplicate H1 on `connected.astro` (EN+ES) demoted to H2; meta descriptions on `connect.astro` (EN+ES) extended from ~115 chars to 153 EN / 151 ES (Ahrefs 150–160 sweet spot).
- Verified post-build: 94 sitemap URLs (was 99 — dropped 4 noindex + 1 internal), zero `connect`/`connected` paths in sitemap, single H1 per page, predeploy audit passes.

### Decisions Made
- **Belt-and-suspenders robots.txt + sitemap filter:** even though sitemap exclusion alone would resolve the hard error, added explicit `Disallow:` so crawlers don't waste budget and the cascade notices clear faster.
- **Demote H1 → H2 on connected error state:** simpler than refactoring to a single dynamic H1; both states render in static HTML even though only one is visible at runtime.
- **Did not include `projects.generated.json`** in PR — it regenerates on every build and would sweep unrelated portfolio diff into an SEO-only PR.
- **GSC service-account auth via base64 env var, not JSON file on disk:** existing project convention is dotenv for all secrets (Brevo, Cloudflare, etc.). Storing the service-account JSON as `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_BASE64` in `.env.local` mirrors that pattern and avoids credential files in the repo. Single-var base64 chosen over multiple separate fields to sidestep the `private_key` newline-escaping footgun.
- **Decision on previous GSC tooling (deleted in d865f97):** the deletion rationale "IndexNow handles passive Bing notification" was incorrect — IndexNow requires active POST submission. Replaced with new `scripts/seo/indexnow-submit.mjs` (committed 0c4a433); GSC submitter to be restored once fresh service-account credentials are provisioned.

### Immediate Next Steps
- [x] Merge PR #95 and confirm Vercel production deploy. (merged adae75d, prod sitemap verified at 92 URLs, zero noindex paths)
- [x] Submit URLs to IndexNow (Bing/Yandex/Seznam/Naver). (202 Accepted for 92 URLs)
- [ ] Provision fresh GCP service account `seo-api-access@cushlabs-seo.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, add as Owner on GSC `sc-domain:cushlabs.ai`, base64-encode JSON key into `.env.local` as `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_BASE64`. (Steps documented in session transcript 2026-05-10.)
- [ ] Restore `scripts/seo/gsc-client.mjs` + `gsc-submit-urls.mjs` from commit 65939dd, swap file-read for env-decode, wire `npm run seo:gsc` into package.json.
- [ ] Trigger fresh Ahrefs crawl post-deploy and confirm error count drops from 4 to 0.
- [ ] Triage 2 high-severity Dependabot alerts on default branch (surfaced during this session's pushes).

### Technical Debt
- 2 new high-severity Dependabot alerts surfaced on push (default branch). Need triage — could be follow-up to the recent CVE sweep in PR #93.
- Pre-existing lint errors in Header/Footer/RecentWork/portfolio (`anchor-is-valid`, `no-noninteractive-element-interactions`) unrelated to this PR.

### Open Questions / Blockers
- None.
