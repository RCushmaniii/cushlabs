    {
      name: "Pricing & Process",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "How much does this cost? Is it SMB-affordable?",
          answer: "Discovery Sprints typically start in the low four figures. Full builds are fixed-scope and quoted after discovery. Designed for SMBs, not enterprise budgets. You'll know the exact cost before I start—no surprises."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does implementation take? Do we need engineers?",
          answer: "Most projects deliver in 2-6 weeks depending on scope. You don't need engineers—just an English-speaking point of contact (Ops/Sales/IT lead) to coordinate. I handle the build, integration, testing, and handoff."
        },
        {
          question: "What's included in a project?",
          answer: "Every project includes: knowledge audit and source structure, assistant personality and tone rules, validation and human handoff paths, analytics dashboard, performance-conscious deployment, and full documentation with an operational runbook."
        },
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Quality & Security",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "What if the AI gives wrong answers and damages our reputation?",
          answer: "I build with validation and source attribution. Every answer is grounded in your approved knowledge sources, and the system hands off to a human when it's uncertain. No prompt spaghetti—just tested, production-grade systems."
        },
        {
          question: "How do you handle data security and privacy?",
          answer: "Privacy-aware design with least-privilege access controls, audit logs, and clear data boundaries. Your internal documents stay private. I document data handling before launch and follow enterprise IT discipline from 17+ years of Fortune 500 IT leadership experience."
        },
        {
          question: "Will this slow down our website or hurt SEO?",
          answer: "No. I design performance-conscious deployments that respect site speed and SEO. Minimal footprint approach—no conversion-killing heavy embeds. I validate page speed and offer dedicated pages if an embed would be too heavy."
        },
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Working Together",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "Who will I be working with?",
          answer: "You work directly with me—Robert Cushman. I'm not a big agency with account managers and handoffs. I do the discovery, development, project management, and I'm personally responsible for your project's success. Direct communication, no middlemen."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you work with companies in Mexico?",
          answer: "Yes. I'm fully bilingual (English/Spanish) and serve clients in both the US and Mexico. Your assistant outputs are fully bilingual, and I offer flexible hours for both time zones."
        },
        {
          question: "We don't have anyone fluent in English. Can you work with Spanish-only teams?",
          answer: "Project delivery runs in English for speed and clarity, but your assistant outputs are fully bilingual (EN/ES). If you don't have an English-speaking champion, I offer a bilingual partner add-on to bridge coordination. Either way, your customers get professional Spanish support."
        },
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Alternatives & Comparisons",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "Can't we just use ChatGPT, Intercom, Zendesk, or hire a freelancer?",
          answer: "Generic tools don't validate answers against your knowledge base, provide bilingual tone control, or connect to business outcomes. Freelancers rarely ship systems with testing, monitoring, and iteration loops. I deliver outcome systems—not demos."
        },
        {
          question: "What makes you different from other AI consultants?",
          answer: "Discovery-first methodology (I don't start with tools, I start with your business problem), production-grade engineering (not just demos), outcome systems tied to business KPIs, cross-border ready for US/Mexico markets, and enterprise discipline with solo speed."
        },
        {
          question: "What if it doesn't work or we're not satisfied?",
          answer: "We test extensively before launch. If something isn't performing, I optimize it during the 30-day support window included in every project. My goal is systems that deliver measurable ROI—typically within 60-90 days of launch."
